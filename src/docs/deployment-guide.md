# Deployment Guide

## Overview

This guide provides instructions for deploying the application to different environments. The application uses a CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments and includes monitoring and alerting for system health.

## Environments

The application can be deployed to the following environments:

- **Development**: For ongoing development and testing
- **Staging**: For pre-production testing
- **Production**: For end-user access

## Prerequisites

Before deploying, ensure you have the following:

- Node.js 18 or higher
- Docker
- Access to the deployment environment
- Necessary API keys and credentials

## CI/CD Pipeline

The application uses a CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments. The pipeline is configured to:

1. Run tests on every push to the repository
2. Build the application and create a Docker image
3. Push the Docker image to a container registry
4. Deploy the application to the appropriate environment based on the branch

### Pipeline Configuration

The CI/CD pipeline is configured using GitHub Actions. The workflow file is located in `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`. The pipeline is triggered on pushes to the main and develop branches.

## Deployment Process

### Manual Deployment

1. Build the application:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Create a Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t knowledge-app:latest .
   ```

3. Push the Docker image to the container registry:
   ```bash
   docker push registry.example.com/knowledge-app:latest
   ```

4. Deploy to the target environment:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f k8s/[environment].yaml
   ```

### Automated Deployment

The CI/CD pipeline automatically deploys the application to the appropriate environment based on the branch:

- **develop branch**: Deploys to the development environment
- **main branch**: Deploys to the production environment

## Monitoring and Alerting

The application includes monitoring and alerting for system health. The monitoring system tracks:

- CPU, memory, and disk usage
- Request rate and response time
- Component health status

Alerts are triggered when:

- CPU or memory usage exceeds configured thresholds
- Disk usage is high
- A component is degraded or down
- Error rate exceeds the configured threshold

## Backup and Recovery

The application includes backup and recovery functionality. Backups can be configured to run:

- Hourly
- Daily
- Weekly

Backups are stored in a secure location and can be used to restore the application in case of data loss or corruption.

## Scaling

The application can be scaled horizontally by adjusting the number of instances. The scaling configuration includes:

- Minimum instances: The minimum number of instances to run
- Maximum instances: The maximum number of instances to run
- CPU threshold: The CPU usage threshold that triggers scaling
- Memory threshold: The memory usage threshold that triggers scaling

## Security

The application includes security features such as:

- Authentication
- API key requirements
- Rate limiting

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Deployment fails**: Check the CI/CD pipeline logs for errors
2. **Application is not accessible**: Check the Kubernetes pod status and logs
3. **High resource usage**: Check the monitoring dashboard for resource usage trends
